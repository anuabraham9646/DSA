while finding unique first character in a string 
	the best solution is instead of creating array or anythin or goinf thru the string
		for(char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) do this go thru the character set
			find its index using   int a= indexOf(c)
			find its last index using  int a= lastIndexOf(c)

 summed area table
 we take all the summ left to right top to bottom
 sum[i][j]= mat[i][j]+sum[i-1]j +sum[i][j-1]  - sum[i-1][j-1]   this extra minus cos 
 mat[i-1] [j-1] occurs in sum[i][j-1]  - sum[i-1][j-1] hence we reduce 1 instance

 in case of binary tree if we need to keep track of parent in the helper function
 witha root we add another TreeNode parameter starting as null
 cos for root null is parent
 and after every left and right jump we set the parent to parent of left or right node that is.
 parent is the root node at that insatnce

 in BFS approach we add 1st node to queue and start while loop
 then inside while loop we check for q size as n
 and start inner loop from i=0 till n-1 
 because inside each while loop we get to know how many elts at that level
 
 
 https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/
 in case of monotonic stack where we have to count how many lesser than
 int res=1;
        while(!s.isEmpty() && price >= s.peek()[1])
            res+=s.pop()[0];
        s.push(new int[]{res,price});
 
 because at each point we are calculating how many less than then 
 if at right something big then that will be 1 plus the value at left of it which is smaller than them

instead of using a map we can use an array of length 2x 
where we perform step like the number line points

bipartition assign a node a colour 
bfs it and go through its edges of the edge have same colour cant do anythin
go through the program well detailed comments
